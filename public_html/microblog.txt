- Booked places to stay for our (SO, cat and I)'s move across the
  country.

- Have some <a href="http://tilde.town/~audy/rectangles.html">rectangles</a>!

- Got a <a href="http://tilde.town/~audy/search/">working demo</a> of a tilde
  search engine up and running. For now, it only crawls tilde.town but I am planning to add other tildes soon.

Tilde Idea Time!!

- ~karlen reminded me of this one: setup a tilde where all users have to run
  programs using PBS/qsub (queue system designed for university compute clusters).

- A tilde where you need at least a 32768-bit RSA key to join (takes 4 hours to
  generate on a laptop). Sign-up process is automated: just SSH in the first time
  and your account is created. Having to generate huge keys will limit signups.

  (there should be no noticeable performance hit due to large keys).

  ps -- if you want to generate a huge SSH key:

  `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 32768 -f ~/.ssh/hugekey`

- Wrote a small BASH script that puts random unicode smiley faces. I `chmod 777`'d
  it so feel free to contribute: /home/audy/Code/smiles. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻. The script
  also appends $1 to the end of the smiley thing so you can do `smiles hello` and get:
  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ hello

- usercounts.txt has the # of uniq logged in users by minute. I was going to
  plot this but someone beat me to the punch.

It was never my intention to make this a blog about tilde-related things but:

1. Host a tilde on an old jailbroken iPhone. Display the iPhone in a gallery with
   `htop` running on its screen.

Tilde ideas:

1. Host a tilde-style server in a remote location. I found a [list of "exotic"
   VPS providers](https://www.exoticvps.com). It would be laggy which would add to
   the fun.

2. Create a tilde with zero net access except for SSH. Any data would have to be
   pushed in through SSH. Users' websites would only be visible via lynx running on
   the tilde server (or again, through an SSH tunnel).

3. In addition to (2), users could create tunnels to other nodes in the tildeverse.
   Perhaps a virtual private network could be created linking tildes.

- Wrote a small script that crawls everyone's $HOME looking for
  directories in ~Code with the goal of facilitating a directory of
  everyone's projects/one-off-perl-scripts.

  See <a href="http://tilde.town/~audy/code.html">here</a>.

- I realized that the guestbook system on this page might actually be the
  "microblog." It wouldn't be difficult to implement a "twitter" using
  a very small shell script.

Tilde ideas

- Build a search engine for tilde sites. Bonus points if it works in static
  html.
- Add a friends.json file to your ~/public_html, then have a bot crawl it and
  build a social graph.
